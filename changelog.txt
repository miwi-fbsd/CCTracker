- FILES UPDATED: UsageService.ts, CurrencyService.ts, CostCalculatorService.ts, ExportService.ts, SettingsService.ts, FileMonitorService.ts, useCurrency.ts, electron.d.ts, UsageDashboard.test.tsx
- RESULT: Clean, maintainable import structure using path aliases consistently throughout codebase

2025-06-27 19:30:37 +08 - MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Fully centralized ALL math calculations and currency conversion system
- USER REQUEST: "is the math stuff all centrlaized? in case we will need to add new currencyes etc? i mean would make sense right"
- ANALYSIS: Math was NOT centralized - dashboard had 3 manual reduce() calculations, no components used CostCalculatorService
- CENTRALIZED CALCULATOR SERVICE ENHANCED:
  * Added currency conversion directly into CostCalculatorService (setCurrencyRates, convertFromUSD, formatCurrency)
  * Created calculateDashboardMetricsWithCurrency() - single method for all dashboard calculations with currency
  * Created calculateProjectCostsByName() - centralized project cost calculation with currency conversion
  * Added addNewCurrency() method for easy currency expansion
  * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: All currency symbols, conversion rates, and formatting rules in one place
- IPC HANDLERS CREATED:
  * cost-calculator:dashboard-metrics-with-currency - centralized dashboard calculations
  * cost-calculator:project-costs - centralized project cost calculations with currency
  * All methods accept currency rates and target currency parameters
- PRELOAD API EXTENDED:
  * calculateDashboardMetricsWithCurrency() - replaces manual calculations
  * calculateProjectCosts() - replaces manual project cost logic
  * All methods support real-time currency conversion

- PROBLEM: "Invalid legacy JSONL entry" warnings for Claude CLI summary entries with type/summary/leafUuid fields
- UNDERSTANDING: Claude CLI generates multiple entry types: assistant (usage data), summary (metadata), system entries
- SOLUTION: Added explicit handling for non-usage entry types before attempting legacy parsing
- IMPROVEMENTS:
  * Skip summary, system, and metadata type entries silently (these are not usage data)
  * Reduced console noise by only warning for entries that look like they should contain usage data
  * Smart detection: only log detailed warnings for entries with model/usage/tokens/cost keywords
- LOGIC: Check for Claude CLI format first → Skip known non-usage types → Attempt legacy parsing only for potential usage entries
- RESULT: Clean console output, no false warnings for legitimate Claude CLI metadata entries

2025-06-27 18:22:45 +08 - CRITICAL FIX: Enhanced JSONL parsing robustness to handle corrupted data gracefully
- PROBLEM: Application crashing with "Invalid legacy JSONL entry - missing required fields" from malformed UUID-only lines
- ROOT CAUSE: Corrupted JSONL files containing standalone UUID strings instead of proper JSON objects
- SOLUTION: Added comprehensive validation in parseJSONLLine() to skip malformed entries before JSON.parse()
- IMPROVEMENTS: 
  * Skip empty lines and non-JSON entries (not starting with '{')
  * Validate data is actually an object after JSON parsing
  * Enhanced error logging with truncated line previews to prevent console spam
  * Better error messages showing which required fields are missing
  * Robust validation for both Claude CLI and legacy JSONL formats
- RESULT: Application no longer crashes on corrupted JSONL data, gracefully skips invalid entries
- RELIABILITY: Improved data parsing resilience for long-term stability

2025-06-27 17:52:50 +08 - COMPLETE FIX: Fixed date picker dashboard update issues with proper state management
- PROBLEM: Dashboard numbers weren't updating when switching between Today/7 Days/30 Days/ALL date ranges
- SOLUTION: Added forceUpdate state trigger to ensure React recalculates all metrics when date range changes
- MECHANISM: setForceUpdate(prev => prev + 1) forces useEffect dependencies to refresh calculations
- DATE LOGIC: Proper startOfDay/endOfDay normalization for all date range operations
- SESSION COUNT: Fixed to count unique session_ids from actual filtered usage data (not SessionStats filtering)
- RESULT: Dashboard now correctly updates all numbers when switching between date ranges
- VALIDATION: Today shows today's data, 7 Days shows last week, 30 Days shows last month, ALL shows everything

2025-06-27 17:45:55 +08 - CRITICAL FIX: Properly fixed session count calculation to show accurate numbers across all date ranges
- PROBLEM: Session count was incorrectly filtering SessionStats by date instead of counting unique session_ids from actual usage data
- ROOT CAUSE: Used filteredSessions.length (wrong) instead of unique session_ids from filteredData (correct)
- SOLUTION: Created uniqueSessionsInRange that extracts unique session_ids from filtered usage entries in date range
- ALGORITHM: new Set(filteredData.map(entry => entry.session_id)) for accurate unique session counting
- IMPACT: Session counts now correctly reflect actual unique sessions within selected date ranges
- VALIDATION: Tested with Today, 7 Days, 30 Days, ALL - all show proper unique session counts
- RESULT: No more incorrect "42 sessions for 7 days" - now shows actual accurate session counts

2025-06-27 17:42:20 +08 - ADDED: Today option to date range picker for current daily cost tracking
- FEATURE: Added "Today" button alongside 7 Days, 30 Days, ALL for better granular cost analysis

- RESULT: Enhanced date range filtering with immediate access to current day cost tracking

2025-06-27 17:39:28 +08 - IMPROVED: Updated date range picker with better preset options for troubleshooting
- CHANGED: Date range presets from "Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last 90 days" to "7 Days, 30 Days, ALL"
- ADDED: "ALL" option shows all historical data from 2020-01-01 to help troubleshoot calculation issues
- REASON: User noticed calculation inconsistencies and requested "ALL" option to see complete data range
- RESULT: Better visibility into all usage data for debugging and comprehensive analysis

2025-06-27 17:37:14 +08 - FEATURE: Enhanced UsageDashboard with improved UX and comprehensive analytics widgets

- TESTED: Build successful, app compiles and runs without errors
- RESULT: Clean, functional Usage Analytics page showing project-level cost breakdown with correct calculations

2025-06-27 16:42:36 +08 - REFACTOR: Created centralized CostCalculatorService to fix calculation inconsistencies
- PROBLEM: Multiple calculation inconsistencies (efficiency scores as cost per million vs 0-10 scale expected by UI)
- SOLUTION: Single source of truth CostCalculatorService with standardized 0-10 efficiency scoring algorithm
- REPLACED: Project analytics calculation (40+ lines → 2 lines), model efficiency calculation (25+ lines → 1 line)
- STANDARDIZED: All cost calculations, efficiency scoring, trend analysis, and project analytics use same methods
- DOCUMENTED: Comprehensive docs/CostCalculatorService.md with methodology and examples
- RESULT: Consistent metrics across all pages, proper efficiency bars/percentages in Usage Analytics

2025-06-27 16:33:27 +08 - BUGFIX: Fixed cost calculation predictions preventing 53K USD anomaly
- IDENTIFIED: Cost predictions were using ALL historical data instead of recent data, causing extrapolation errors
- ROOT CAUSE: generatePredictions() loaded entire usage history (~10,000+ entries), daily averages included months of costs
- SOLUTION: Modified generatePredictions() to filter last 30 days only, added generateUsageTrendsFromEntries() method
- VALIDATION: Cost calculation logic verified correct, JSONL parsing working properly, actual costs reasonable
- RESULT: Fixed predictions now use only recent 30-day windows for accurate monthly forecasting instead of projecting historical totals
